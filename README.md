## Project Status

In progress.  Project started to take a site I'd developed using Bootstrap, Express, Ejs, and hosted on Heroku and convert it to a static site, hosted on Amazon S3 with the aim of speeding up the experience, and reducing the monthly cost to host.  

Currently the MVP is finished, and after some optimising this will take over the site currently live at https://www.essentialcoaching.co.uk/.
